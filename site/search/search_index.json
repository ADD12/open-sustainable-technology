All the giant Internet companies build their platforms based on free and open technology like Docker, Linux, Python, React, Kubernetes, or TensorFlow [2] . Can these success stories inspire us in our most vital challenges today? Deep Dive into Open and Sustainable Technology \u00b6 In our search for open and sustainable technology, we have come across a number of very ambitious and high-quality projects. Unfortunately, there was no sign of activity in most of them. Many of these projects are open source but hard to find. As there is no project index in this area so far, it is not easy for developers worldwide to find these \"gems\" and to build upon the work already done. This results in time loss and inhibits innovation. Focussing on active projects helps us to ensure active communication and knowledge transfer. Many domains already show the emergence of strong communities. Based on our research, we were able to identify a general trend towards open and sustainable technologies. In the last two years, in particular, a large number of astonishing projects have been developed. In particular, the photovoltaic and wind turbine sector shows a large number of professional projects. It was very impressive to see a 15-MW offshore wind turbine, which was developed in cooperation between the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and the Technical University of Denmark. Almost all technical documentation has been provided under the MIT Open Source License [3] . This standard will allow companies and research institutions to further develop and use this technology without major intellectual property barriers. Many tools around the development are also available under an open license. On the basis of these technologies, it is possible to secure a large part of the energy supply for entire coastal regions. Although this is a historic step, the 62 stars on GitHub indicate how little attention is still paid to this field. A CAD model of the nacelle layout of the 15-MW direct-drive wind turbine. Hidden Gems \u00b6 In the field of energy system modeling and climate research, we found some larger communities and projects which have evolved over a long period of time. Many high-quality data sets can be found in this area. Unfortunately, even after intensive research, some areas are still very thinly covered. These include the areas of energy storage, carbon capture, bioenergy, recycling, and waste. Especially in the area of waste classification by artificial intelligence, we expected a lot of software and datasets. The sad truth is that there are hundreds of large open source projects to classify and track people, but only a handful for classification and segmentation of waste within an image. Even the largest project in this field, called TACO, seems to be unable to get the attention it deserves and has no sponsors today [4] . In general, the impression is that most projects are developed further by public institutions, research institutes, and private individuals. Large companies can only be found in a few places. The global impact of companies investing in open sustainable projects is much larger when enabling others to do the same. Segmantation and classification of litter with TACO A Direct Comparison \u00b6 Since protontypes also maintains an awesome list in the field of robotics, we are able to make a direct comparison between the two fields. The number of active and high-quality projects maintained by a worldwide community is significantly larger in robotics [5] . Many projects build upon each other and simplify research and development. If we had the same level of activity and contribution within the field of sustainable technologies, we would be very confident that climate change and the loss of natural resources can still be averted. Through our organization protontypes we will accelerate the trend towards open and sustainable technology. The list of awesome sustainable technologies is the first central piece of the puzzle that was missing. In this way, we hope to increase the transfer of knowledge in this area and help others identify areas not covered by open toolkits and data sets. Especially in the field of software development, this will enable people around the world to tackle one of the most central problems of our time from the comfort of their own homes. The strength of open development methods is already clearly visible in many high-tech areas. Let's concentrate this strength on one of the most central problems of our time.","title":"Gathering Open Sustainable Technology"},{"location":"blog/gathering_open_sustainable_technology/#gathering-open-sustainable-technology","text":"Tobias Augspurger \u00b7 Tjark D\u00f6ring \u00b7 Felix Dietze \u00b7 Johannes Karoff \u00b7 October 20, 2020 As climate change is a globally emerging challenge, protontypes is starting the unique attempt to map all open sustainable technology in one list.

The reasons for this are manifold and can be supported by social and technological arguments. Applications range from open hardware such as wind turbines and PVs to open data and software packages that are publicly available for modification and redistribution. Using open source technologies is critical to deliver cross-system sustainability goals as they offer: Trust . Open practices ensure transparency and trust in the deployment of various technologies and keep governments and other actors accountable to their climate pledges . Localisation and customisation . Open, sustainable innovations allow for customisation of individual and cultural needs throughout the product development process. Climate Justice . Open access to knowledge, data and technologies can help reduce the power imbalance . When we centre climate action around those who bear the burden of environmental injustice, we can discover new empowering uses for open technology. Resource efficiency . Multiple actors are investing in data products, algorithms, and software, leading to duplication, incoherent outcomes, and inefficient use of resources. Open source means each problem only has to be solved once. Collaboration . To address complex challenges related to climate change, cross-functional collaboration between different sectors is necessary. The complexity of planetary sustainability cannot be met by solutions based on a single discipline, state, or enterprise. The health and vibrancy of open sustainable technologies \u00b6 Developing and maintaining open-source software relies on an integration of the technical (e.g. how open-source code is engineered and maintained); the social (e.g. the communities around particular open source projects and their values); and the organisational (e.g. formal open source institutions and cross-cutting regulations, financing, and governance). While we see a broader trend toward open source technology projects, there is no evidence on which projects can be considered critical digital infrastructure for climate change mitigation and where significant funding and resourcing gaps exist. To our knowledge, there has been no systematic study of these intricacies and dynamics of the open source landscape with a focus on sustainability applications. After a year of intensive mapping of the open source software landscape for climate action on OpenSustain.tech , we will analyse the health and vibrancy of this emerging ecosystem . The selection of projects was based on simple rules from the Contribution Guide . We want to discover: areas where this digital infrastructure is mature; where tools or processes exist that funders should support instead of forging a new path; new possibilities to connect various projects; and general concerns and hurdles that have limited the development of best practice. We expect that triangulating these dynamics would shed light on important economic and governance issues that lead us towards a more diverse and well-funded ecosystem for critical digital infrastructure for planetary sustainability . Our approach \u00b6 We have collected, crowdsourced and curated ~1000 actively developed open source projects. Using this database as a starting point and the GitHub API we will analyse the interrelations & dependencies between key projects as well as the number of contributors, project growth, and key topics and organisations among other metrics. This analysis will highlight thematic gaps and provide a better understanding of the criticality of specific projects. We are using a variety of the CHAOSS Metrics to measure the state of a project. We acknowledge that solely using Github for our quantitative analysis is a limitation of our approach and plan to add more platforms soon. In addition, beginning in January 2022, we will conduct a series of interviews with project developers and contributors to learn about their challenges, incentives, and needs; the financial viability of these projects; and the barriers that have hampered the development of best practice and more equitable developer communities. Finally, beginning in spring 2022, we plan to strengthen the interconnectivity of different developer and user groups through a series of community workshops . Preliminary findings \u00b6 In our preliminary analysis we discovered that many projects exist in the solar and wind turbine sectors, as well as data-rich domains like energy system modelling and climate science. Unfortunately, other areas, such as energy storage, emissions monitoring, and sustainable financing, are still underserved or underdeveloped. If we use the number of stars as a measure of popularity, we quickly notice that even the most successful projects in the field are very unpopular compared to other areas such as open source robotics . Our research also revealed that many of these initiatives are still hard to find and difficult for programmers and scientists to build upon. Some projects use self-hosted GitLab instances, and as a result, only be identified by searching package manager indexes or scientific publications.

Given the complexity of the changes required, a global and open collaboration is essential. Here are 4 reasons why a transition towards sustainability should follow open practices. Transparency and Trust \u00b6 A sustainable economy requires a common understanding of how our actions affect the environment. It is the question about which practices and technologies are sustainable in the long term. In practice, many options show a high degree of complexity and it is not always certain whether a solution will be economically, environmentally or socially sustainable. Can recycling of solar cells been done in an economical way? Could carbon capture and storage be an economically and environmentally viable option? Is the land used to produce biofuel crops competing with the production of food? Open practices can be crucial to ensure transparency and trust in finding answers. Open datasets, models and access can create a global discussion without running the risk of being covertly influenced by individual interests. This approach has already created a global scientific consensus of the human impact on climate change with results that can be reproduced by everyone. Another challenge is to reach a shared understanding of what steps are needed to address this issue. Tools such as open life cycle assessments play a central role in measuring the environmental footprint of products and services. With the help of public data and open models, it creates transparent metrics to evaluate their sustainability. This practice provides widespread trust, encouraging sustainable behaviors among consumers and businesses. Knowledge Evolution and Adaptation \u00b6 Open Data and models are not the only fields building transparency and trust. Opening knowledge and technology will make our economy more sustainable. The tools we use nowadays to design new technology are the result of centuries worth of collaboration. They emerged in the form of mathematics, algorithms, and programming languages. Today, 70% of the world's codebase is open source and software development has become one of the most innovative industries. The results are revolutionary and cutting-edge developments in robotics, artificial intelligence or blockchain, just to name a few. With the advancements made in global communication, we can apply the creative methods behind software development to more traditional fields. With knowledge available to everybody, people will be able to maintain and adjust technology by themselves. For example, open agriculture can be used and adapted by farmers to improve their crops' sustainability. Practices like these enable faster global transition that meets local conditions and cultural needs. Collaborative Innovation \u00b6 In his 2003 book \u201cOpen Innovation\u201d , Chesbrough first coined the term open innovation as a novel innovation strategy. Initially, it meant a straightforward contradiction of the traditional and secretive R&D mindset towards corporate innovation. However, the trend for openness and collaboration between and within companies has rapidly expanded. Over time, it has become an active innovation-seeking path for the whole ecosystem that further pushes the technological development and knowledge boundaries. Most importantly, this collaborative approach is crucial when considering the ever-increasing product complexity. An aspect that makes it difficult for even the largest companies to carry out the whole development process in-house. In particular, mobility solutions, food and changes in our housing characteristics require the personal and cultural needs to be included in the design process from the beginning. Otherwise, we run the risk of developing sustainable solutions without taking people's lifestyles into account. Two evident benefits of adopting an open innovation strategy are the setting up a common language between the contributors and standardization of ways to collaborate. This, in turn, translates into substantial competitive advantages from the commercial perspective: better adaptation for new business opportunities, increased flexibility in the developed solutions, as well as a faster and cheaper route to launch a product into the market. Most importantly, by integrating users into the design processes, the idea of partnership towards a larger and shared goal also brings new ways of doing business. Open Business Models \u00b6 Free and open practices emerged with the idea of empowering freedom for all users. Also, the advantages of cooperative software development for common standards and a higher code quality became obvious. What seems unimaginable to many is the development of a profitable company based on free and open practices. Nonetheless, over the last decade, companies have shown with great success how sustainable and open business models can look like. Open Core, as one of the most prominent open business models, combines the practices of adaptation, transparency and collaborative innovation. A new billion-dollar business methodology has emerged and provides the basic infrastructure for our digital world. What initially seemed possible only for software development is now being transferred to new areas as can be seen in the development of semiconductors with the rise of the RISC-V initiative. Hundreds of organization are working together to create an open ecosystem to ensure free and open design of computing architectures and processors in the future. The same mindset can be applied to other sustainable technologies that define our lives. The advantages of applying an open practices to the development of sustainable technologies are cleared up. The baseline for this development has already been set by many projects and is now visible through the projects listed at OpenSustain.tech . It is now up to us whether or not we are able to apply the practices that have brought us the greatest innovation to the problems that challenge us the most.","title":"Open Principles for a Sustainable Technology Transition"},{"location":"blog/open_principles_for_a_sustainable_technology_transition/#open-principles-for-a-sustainable-technology-transition","text":"Tobias Augspurger \u00b7 Alejandro Aristi \u00b7 Tjark D\u00f6ring \u00b7 January 29, 2021 A transformation towards a sustainability-driven economy will challenge all of the upcoming generations.

The same mindset can be applied to other sustainable technologies that define our lives. The advantages of applying an open practices to the development of sustainable technologies are cleared up. The baseline for this development has already been set by many projects and is now visible through the projects listed at OpenSustain.tech . It is now up to us whether or not we are able to apply the practices that have brought us the greatest innovation to the problems that challenge us the most.","title":"Open Business Models"},{"location":"blog/openness_as_a_key_indicator_for_sustainable_investment/","text":"Openness as a Key Indicator for Sustainable Investment \u00b6 Tobias Augspurger \u00b7 January 29, 2022 An open-source strategy for measuring sustainable investments can fundamentally impact the transition to a carbon-neutral and green economy. Measuring corporate sustainability based on quantitative physical values combined with Open Science practices has the potential to avoid greenwashing as the biggest threat to economical transformation. In the coming decade, the world will face profound changes in order to establish ecological norms and rules for our economy. The financial industry will be at the center of this transition, determining which companies and technologies are granted the resources they need to spearhead this evolution. In recent years there has been a systematic shift toward evaluating companies not just on monetary but also on ethical and environmental criteria. Non-financial factors known as Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) are frequently used to evaluate companies. Today about 40% of total assets worldwide under management are sustainable investments rated by ESG scores [1] . The high demand for such financial products is driving massive growth, with a predicted market share of over 95% by 2030 [2] . Figure 1 clearly shows the massive growth in this sector: Figure 1: Global AUM invested in ESG mandates (in USD tn) Despite this promising development, greenhouse gas emissions like carbon dioxide are still accelerating [3] . Humanity stand to lose climate stability and biodiversity, and thus our livelihoods, before the end of this century. Why is the trend toward sustainable investment not reflected to the same extent in physically measurable environmental variables? The following figure clearly shows how little CO\u2082 emissions are influenced by the trend towards sustainable investment. Figure 2: Annual CO\u2082 emissions They are not measured on the impact they deliver \u00b6 People in the financial industry are becoming increasingly aware of this inconsistent development. Today's ESG ratings are questioned by insiders from numerous institutions. Kenneth P. Pucker sums up the problem in his blog post \"The Trillion-Dollar Fantasy\" in a single sentence [4] : \"They are not measured on the impact they deliver\". Deutsche Bank's former ESG officer, Desiree Fixler, publicly expressed her concerns regarding the legitimacy of the company's claims on the percentage of assets under management that merit an \"ESG\" or green label. [5] . Tariq Fancy former Chief Investment Officer for sustainable investing at BlackRock argues his essay \"The Secret Diary of a Sustainable Investor\" [6] : We need political leaders who are competent, evidence-based, and sufficiently non-partisan to focus primarily on how we can fix the rules of the game. Given the sheer volume of sustainable investments, it should come as no surprise that businesses around the world are trying to represent their existing business models as green and sustainable in terms of ESG ratings. Without a positive evaluation, these companies will probably lose a large part of their future investment. As a result, considerable greenwashing has increased in recent years. [7] . ESG is used to measure the quality of green marketing campaigns \u00b6 Thus one of the critical pieces for the green transition is establishing the appropriate methodology and standards to accurately evaluate the impact of companies on the environment and society. When examining ESG scoring in its current form, it becomes clear that robust scientific approaches do not inform these \"measurements\". Instead, companies produce ESG reports using a range of questionnaires that vary significantly by industry. ESG rating agencies process these reports using a mix of manual and automated methods. For example, natural language processing algorithms, a subset of artificial intelligence, are used to process public media and sustainability reports to assess how \"green\" a company is behaving [8] [9] . ESG experts worldwide advocate for the standardisation of ESG reports and hope for guidance at European Union. [10] . However, since this is an empirical topic, one should rather look in the direction of science. Since the current methods of ESG ratings are also known to companies, they are trying to \"represent\" their own company, technology and business models as ecologically as possible to the outside world under all circumstances with the help of massiv green marketing. If you take a closer look at the algorithms and methods, you will see that ESG is used to determine the quality and quantity of green marketing campaigns. The following figure shows how such an assessment is created today using data-driven approaches. [11] Figure 3: A Data-driven Approach to Environmental, Social and Governance Independent scientific analyses and peer reviews of their own reports are the exception here. Each company designs its ESG reports at its own discretion. Also reports from the media are in the rarest cases purely objective nature and it is therefore very questionable to include them. Political and corporate influence on the public media can not be denied in many countries. Reproducible knowledge creation \u00b6 Science has faced similar challenges in the past as it does today with respect to ESG. The complexity of scientific experiments has led to the so-called replication crisis [12] . New tools such as neutral networks and other very complex processing chains of data made scientific results very difficult for other scientists to replicate. The published papers were not sufficient to inform outsiders about the underlying data, instruments, methods, and steps. In many respects, this development is analogous to the reports on the impact of companies on their environment. In the field of climate science, but also in many other scientific fields, there has therefore been a fast transformation in recent years. The triumph of Open Science, Open Access, Open Data and Open Source can no longer be denied [13] . Satellite data, climate models, software tools and the associated programming languages are now open and freely available. Instead of arguing about the results of non-transparent studies, it is now possible to discuss scientific details of how the results were obtained. However, as long as this is done according to open principles, discussions remain scientific, objective, and evidence-based. Thus, even the last doubts about the existence of climate change could be dispelled. Today there are no studies based on open principles, which are able to disprove the existence of climate change. Open Science and scientific discourse create reproducible knowledge. Open science communities like Pangeo represent prime examples of this field and show how Earth Science has been transformed by Open Source and Open Science. Emerging patforms like Papers with Code or Journal of Open Source Software created a new mindset on how knowledge can be published and reviewed in public. Within the energy modeling community, a key backbone of the energy transition, there is a strong trend toward open knowledge modeling. Whether and to what extent our energy supply can be covered by purely renewable energies can therefore be discussed transparently, in detail and scientifically by scientific communities such as openmod in order to find a common consensus. Figure 4: Open Data and Open Source creating a transparent energy system modeling The trend to openness in general is also strongly visible in digital industries creating a new mindset on how to do business. Emerging Business Concept like \"Open Core\" have led to IPO of $11 Billion just by a single company called Gitlab in 2021 [14] . Commercial Open Source Software Companies and Open Source in general is changing the way how data is processed and how we make decision based on the results [15] . 85% of software products today stands on the shoulders of the Open Source movement [16] . Precision and automation are not always valued \u00b6 Unfortunately, this mindset is only found in very limited use within ESG and sustainable investment. This becomes clear when looking at the active Open Source projects in this domain. Based on OpenSustain.tech , there are only 10 active Open Source projects in the area of sustainable investment. Even the strong project like SBTi Temperature Alignment tool , OS-Climate or r2dii.analysis are very small compared to other Open Source projects. As part of OS Climate, a number of companies including Amazon, Red Hat, Airbus, Goldmann Sachs, and Microsoft have joined together within the Linux Foundation to develop an open framework for climate related investments. However, if you take a look at the repositories behind, you will quickly realize that the project is still far from a practical application even after 2 years. Although Open Source is known to provide solid and global standardization for the processing of data, there is only one attempt to standardize the ESG scoring method itself. Cary Krosinsky and the team of Real Impact Tracker released their methodology on GitHub with a blog post giving more background information [17] [18] . Nicolaas Koster, Matthias Memminger and Stefan Woerner published similar articles about the high potentical of an Open Source ESG framework and methodology [19] [20] . Despite all these initial thoughts and first good efforts, no professional Open Source rating ESG framework can be found today. ElectricityMap is one of the very few commercial Open Source platforms with a community and a technical solution that is appropriate to solve problems related to business impact on climate change. But even CEO Olivier Corradi admits that automation and precision are less in demand than one might think when it comes to corporate carbon footprints [21] . Figure 5: Nicolaas Koster illustrates how ESG is suffering from a lack of transparency Source Openness as a key indicator for sustainability \u00b6 Nevertheless, the problems within sustainable investment clearly show that transparent and repeatable ESG scoring results are in demand. A company that makes it possible to disclose its own sustainability on the basis of \"Open Science\" has an unbeatable unique selling point in the battle for green investments. In the rating of companies, \"openness\" has the potential to become a criterion in itself making clear to what extent data and models behind the ESG reports of a company are disclosed. This allows the uncertainties and associated error bars to be calculated over sustainability statements. It enables the development of an independent scientific community concerned with corporate sustainability. Openness about one's own sustainability would demonstrate the will to transform even those companies that have not yet made much progress in this area. Unfortunately, recent developments have shown that decisions about the sustainability of industrial sectors and technolgy are not subject to transparent scientific evaluation. Decisions in this area are strongly influenced by intrasparent political decision-making processes [23] . A study based on Open Science principles would provide a transparent and objective answer to the question of whether gas power plants or nuclear power have a positive impact on the environment. It would also allow to talk about risks and potentials if these technologies are used worldwide in a larger scale. Conclusion \u00b6 The Open Source and Open Science movements have changed the way how to collaborate on digital product development and science today. Yet there is not a single company in the world that transparently discloses its impact on the environment through Open Science. Such a development, however, is the only way to verify the multitude of climate pledges made by companies. Many countries and civil organizations are already showing how such a development can look like. The question is how to incentivize companies to enable Open Science for their own environmental sustainability. One way would be to measure the openness of ESG reports and their underlying data and models.","title":"Openness as a key indicator for sustainable investment"},{"location":"blog/openness_as_a_key_indicator_for_sustainable_investment/#openness-as-a-key-indicator-for-sustainable-investment","text":"Tobias Augspurger \u00b7 January 29, 2022 An open-source strategy for measuring sustainable investments can fundamentally impact the transition to a carbon-neutral and green economy.

Read the extended website version of the PDF version Tobias Augspurger \u00b7 Eirini Malliaraki \u00b7 Josh Hopkins \u00b7 January 11, 2023 Open source culture has demonstrated how transparent and collaborative innovation can support modern digital services, data, and infrastructure. Yet, despite its transformative impact and use within an estimated 97% of digital products, the potential of open source for developing environmentally sustainable technologies is not well understood. Open source software (OSS) accelerates the transition to a sustainable economy by supporting traceable decision-making, building capacity for localization and customization of climate technologies, and most importantly, helping to prevent greenwashing. This transition requires technological innovation and new opportunities for society to participate in developing and adopting technologies. Opensustain.tech has recently published a study providing the first analysis of the health and vibrancy of OSS in sustainability and climate technology. The analysis covered multiple dimensions, including technical, social, and organizational. The report also highlights key risks and challenges for users, developers, and decision-makers, as well as opportunities for more systemic collaboration. For the past two years, more than one thousand actively developed open source projects and organizations were collected and systematically analyzed using qualitative and quantitative methods as part of the Open Sustainable Technology project and the associated database . Community engagement \u00b6 Opensustain.tech found 996 active project repositories on GitHub that had at least one commit or a closed issue in the last year. Although stars are not a perfect metric, we counted 127,038 stars across these projects. Still, a search on GitHub revealed 27 projects have more stars than the entire software in environmental sustainability combined! This is one indicator that open source still plays a minor role as a long-term transformation strategy in sustainability compared to other domains. Topic \u00b6 Additionally, half of all identified projects are in data-rich fields such as climate science, biosphere, energy system modeling, transportation, and buildings. Other topics, such as carbon offsets, battery technology, sustainable investment, emission observation, and integrated assessment modeling, show few notable developments. Based on popularity growth, opensustain.tech also identified newly emerging topics, such as green software. Moreover, most identified projects are relatively young, with a median age of 4.45 years. Fig.1 - All studied projects grouped into the corresponding fields and topics Programming language \u00b6 The analysis of the number and use of programming languages provided further insight into the coding skills required and the nature of the projects. For example, opensustain.tech found Python dominated the OSS movement for sustainability, and is used in 39.8% of all projects, followed by R (16.7%), and lastly Jupyter notebooks (9.34%). This indicates a strong focus on analyzing large datasets, where Python and Jupyter Notebooks are increasingly dominant and less focused on web applications. Fig.2 - Distribution of programming languages License \u00b6 The use of various licenses revealed potential intellectual property issues related to the use of software packages as well as the general openness of the projects. Opensustain.tech found permissive licenses like BSD, Apache and MIT are the most popular in sustainability. The MIT license was the top choice, used in 26% of the projects, followed by the copyleft license GPLv3 (17.3% of all projects). Project size \u00b6 Analysis of knowledge, work, and project governance distribution revealed small, open source communities lead most of the development. On average, open source software projects rely heavily on a single developer responsible for approximately 70% of the contributions to a project. This indicates a higher contributor risk, which may jeopardize the future of many of these projects. Geography \u00b6 Most OSS projects (64%) are based in Europe and North America, with a small number of projects from the Global South. Despite having more GitHub users than Europe, Asia accounts for only 1.9% of organizations working in OSS for sustainability. Fig.3 - Global distribution of identified organisations Recommendations \u00b6 Based on this analysis, opensustain.tech proposes recommendations for those interested in supporting open source software in environmental sustainability more effectively through community building, policy development, and future investment. Collaboration : strengthen the interconnectivity of the identified open source communities and connecting projects to local use cases is paramount for the long-term impact and stability of the ecosystem. It's also key to adapt and extend existing open source projects for underrepresented countries in the Global South. Funding : further support is required in the form of an open earth intelligence incubator and other support programs for open source software in environmental sustainability, as well as ongoing, dedicated funds for development and maintenance. Technical : the OSS community of users and developers should develop better technical interfaces between platforms, data, models, and open-source tools across and within sectors to \u201cstop reinventing the wheel\u201d, and standardize environmental data exchange across different levels of government. Advocacy : close the knowledge gap on the environmental impact of companies through open source principles and transforming financial institutions through transparent and scientific decision-making for sustainable investments. Digital and sustainable transformation must converge as a digital public good if we are to achieve agreed environmental goals and create a safe and equitable corridor for people and the planet. Open sustainability principles can help governments, research institutes, nongovernmental organizations, and businesses move quickly toward science-based decarbonization and conservation of natural resources and ecosystems by providing critical transparency, traceable decision-making, and collaboration on innovation.

Earth's uniqueness in creating a stable environment for life in a completely hostile space is a miracle. Various life forms have taken billions of years to build up the natural resources humans depend on, such as a protective atmosphere, fertile soil, stable weather, and clean drinking water. As a movement to democratize technology development and knowledge creation, open source has the potential to become the central driver in preserving this stability. Here are four different ways you can preserve the livability of the planet by using, supporting, and participating in open source projects, and more than 20 resources to help you get started. Measure, optimize, and reduce \u00b6 Before taking action, it is important to assess your impact on the environment in a scientific way. With more accurate information, you can focus your efforts where the most potential lies. Open science discloses the models behind these measurements, which reduces uncertainties in the long term through continuous improvement and observation. Open source tools make it possible to remain objective and make meaningful comparisons to guide decision making. These decisions happen constantly, both in the consumption of everyday resources and in the use and development of digital products. Software developers find their work in digital products all over the world. Measuring and reducing the energy consumption of these products is the goal of open source tools like Scaphandre , Cloud Carbon Footprint , and kube-green . These tools help you track power consumption, estimate carbon emissions, and even shut down resources when they are not needed. Figure 1: Cloud Carbon Footprint is an open-source project, sponsored by Thoughtworks Inc (Cloud Carbon Footprint, Apache License, Version 2.0) The open source platform electricityMap calculates and predicts the carbon intensity of electric power consumption within electrical grids worldwide on an hourly basis. You or your business can take action by using this information to shift computation to times when there is a high share of renewable energy sources in the electricity grid, thereby reducing emissions. The open source community of OpenEnergyMonitor enables people to monitor and understand the electrification of their homes. Open hardware and open source tools created by OpenEnergyMonitor track and log usage data from multiple categories, including electric vehicles, heat pumps, and photovoltaics. Their learning platform offers a deep understanding of the possibilities for increasing the use of sustainable energy in your household and becoming energy independent. At the heart of it all is the emonPi energy monitor and base station, which can bring together information about your energy consumption from multiple sensor nodes. Figure 2: The OpenEnergyMonitor Solar PV monitor provides real-time and historical information on solar generation and on-site consumption. (OpenEnergyMonitor, CC BY-SA 4.0) Understand the planet \u00b6 The Earth is a highly complex system, which makes it vitally important to better understand the impact humans have on this system. Several open science and open source projects are working to improve transparency and cooperation in this area. Various tutorials offer beginners an introduction to the programming languages and tools used in this field. These tutorials allow you to improve your programming skills while simultaneously learning more about the environment. An Introduction to Earth and Environmental Data Science provides a beginner-friendly introduction to the use of open source Python tools, how these tools can be used, and data science in general. Instead of introducing the basics of Python with routine robotics projects, learners discover how to use Python and programming tools to interpret data about the planet. Figure 3: Understanding and representing earth observation data, such as this map of sea ice concentration, is a central part of the Introduction to Earth and Environmental Data Science course. (Ryan Abernathey, CC BY-SA 4.0) The Climate Laboratory provides the perfect starting point for getting a deeper understanding of climate change and the physical science behind it. Like the previous example, this course includes tutorials to use Python, one of the main tools for climate scientists today. The textbook is a living document that has been created around climlab to provide a powerful but entry-level friendly tool for climate modeling. Figure 4: You can learn to make maps illustrating surface air temperature anomalies due to CO2 doubling Earth Lab provides Earth data science lessons that will help you learn how to work with data in the R and Python programming languages. All course material is open source. Nonspecialists who enroll in the Earth data analytics online course help ensure that understanding how the planet works is not just an academic exercise but also a field of knowledge used in all parts of society. Observe the planet \u00b6 Satellites provide a unique tool to map the state of the planet. Even small changes in our ecosystems such as greenhouse gas emissions, land use change, biodiversity loss, soil drought, or water pollution can be measured with high temporal and spatial resolution.. The data collected here are calibrated to the highest scientific standards and therefore provide an objective view of Earth. Recent years have seen a massive democratization of data and software tools in this field. NASA and ESA have published many data sets and tools from various satellite missions under a free license. The condition of even the most remote forests can be assessed with the help of satellite images in different spectra. All kinds of forest health indicators can be derived from data, like deforestation risk , wildfire risk , or tree detection . By using and improving these tools, you can actively contribute to preserving this ecosystem. Only by measuring and disclosing such information can environmentalists demonstrate that habitats are being lost. You can also learn how to process satellite data using modern image processing algorithms such as neural networks. One of the most robust communities in this field is Global Forest Watch . Here, multiple datasets are combined to give an interactive overview of the health of forests worldwide. Figure 5: Spatial probability of deforestation on Guadeloupe Projects like Resource Watch and Radiant Earth provide entry-level platforms for people anywhere to understand natural resources based on Earth-observation technology. NASA provides its own open source platform, NASA Harvest , to map the state of crops, providing essential information about food security. Another way to get insights about possible hunger crises is the measurement of soil moisture, which is also possible from space with packages like smapr . The ever-increasing resolution of satellite data in recent years means that even the impact of individual companies on the environment can be measured. This new field of science is called spatial finance, and its purpose is to guide business development and investment in alignment with good sustainability practices. The first open datasets in this field track the locations and companies involved in cement production , iron and steel production , and global coal, oil, and gas supply chains . The Carbon Mapper platform shows how to build pressure on companies by disclosing methane and carbon dioxide sources. Figure 6: Global coal, oil, and gas asset-level data (Lucas Kruitwagen, MIT License) Demand openness \u00b6 Environmental catastrophes are often accompanied by a cover-up and manipulation of scientific findings and information. This applies to climate change as well as local environmental impacts. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has given a clear warning following the release of the international climate change report, which shows no trend reversal in global warming and the loss of biodiversity in 2022. We are on a pathway to global warming of more than double the 1.5\u00b0C limit agreed in Paris. Some government and business leaders are saying one thing, but doing another. Simply put, they are lying. And the results will be catastrophic. This is a climate emergency. Figure 7: With the help of pyam you can process the data behind the latest UN report and thus better understand the different scenarios. (pyam, Apache license) One of the easiest ways to change course is to consistently demand open science concerning environmental issues. Openness is a key indicator of sustainable development, because anyone pursuing truly sustainable intentions is interested in refining their conclusions through open scientific discourse. Openness will also help prevent greenwashing, or the practice of promoting a company's sustainability efforts through marketing while scientific findings and conclusions about environmental impacts are downplayed or held private. The next time you buy products that claim to be carbon neutral, ask for independent studies and data. If a politician demands questionable measures for environmental protection, ask for open model calculations and open access studies on this topic. Do you want to invest in a sustainable investment fund? Ask for open scientific studies, data, and models on why this investment is sustainable. Demanding openness in all these ways helps limit greenwashing and ensures that companies' environmental impacts are verifiable, accountable, and traceable.","title":"You can preserve the Earth's livability with open source"},{"location":"blog/you_can_preserve_the_earth_s_livability_with_open_source/#you-can-preserve-the-earths-livability-with-open-source","text":"_Tobias Augspurger _ \u00b7 May 23, 2022 Why actions rooted in open source culture can make a big impact.
